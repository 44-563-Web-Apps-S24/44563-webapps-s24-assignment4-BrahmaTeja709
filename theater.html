        <h1>Kunchala Brahma Teja does Chekov tonight</h1>
        <h2>HE CHERRY ORCHARD Anton Chekov</h2>
        <p>NAZAROVNA. [Wrapping up SAVVA'S feet] Sleep, little father.

            SAVVA. What sleep can I have? If only I had the patience to endure this
            pain, mother; sleep's quite another matter. A sinner doesn't deserve to
            be given rest. What's that noise, pilgrim-woman?
            
            NAZAROVNA. God is sending a storm. The wind is wailing, and the rain is
            pouring down, pouring down. All down the roof and into the windows like
            dried peas. Do you hear? The windows of heaven are opened... [Thunder]
            Holy, holy, holy...
            
            FEDYA. And it roars and thunders, and rages, sad there's no end to
            it! Hoooo... it's like the noise of a forest.... Hoooo.... The wind is
            wailing like a dog.... [Shrinking back] It's cold! My clothes are wet,
            it's all coming in through the open door... you might put me through a
            wringer.... [Plays softly] My concertina's damp, and so there's no music
            for you, my Orthodox brethren, or else I'd give you such a concert, my
            word!--Something marvellous! You can have a quadrille, or a polka, if
            you like, or some Russian dance for two.... I can do them all. In the
            town, where I was an attendant at the Grand Hotel, I couldn't make any
            money, but I did wonders on my concertina. And, I can play the guitar.
            
            A VOICE FROM THE CORNER. A silly speech from a silly fool.
            
            FEDYA. I can hear another of them. [Pause.]
            
            NAZAROVNA. [To SAVVA] If you'd only lie where it was warm now, old man,
            and warm your feet. [Pause.] Old man! Man of God! [Shakes SAVVA] Are you
            going to die?
            
            FEDYA. You ought to drink a little vodka, grandfather. Drink, and it'll
            burn, burn in your stomach, and warm up your heart. Drink, do!</p>
